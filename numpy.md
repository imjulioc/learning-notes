# Numpy

## Matrix addition

if both objects are shape different, numpy repeats the elements of the lesser size matrix until it fits the other matrix.

## Numpy search sorted function

Unlike other languages, search sorted function will return -1 if the target isnâ€™t found, otherwise will return the position to keep the array sorted.)
