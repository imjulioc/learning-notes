# Docker basic concepts

**This is not the first or best attempt to explain the basic concepts of *Docker***.

I followed a video tutorial [\(Thanks to Tech world with Nana\)](https://youtu.be/3c-iBn73dDE) on how to start using *Docker* and I took some notes on the things that seemed more important to me, so I think it's a good idea to use github to save the notes and keep a version control if necessary. Anyway, it's just my opinionated version of what I understood, so some concepts might be wrong.

[Official *Docker* documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) is always recommended.
